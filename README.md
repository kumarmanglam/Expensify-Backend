## Project Overview

The Expense Application Backend is a robust Java Spring Boot application designed to handle the server-side logic for the Expense Management Full Stack Application. It communicates with the frontend, manages user authentication, handles data storage/retrieval, and ensures the security and integrity of the application.

## Features

- Full-fledged Spring Boot application.
- JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- RESTful API endpoints for user management and expense handling.
- Integration with a MySQL database for data storage.
- Data compression for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Secure password storage using Spring Security.

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Spring Security
- MySQL
- Maven

## Prerequisites

Before running the backend server, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Database

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-application-backend.git
   ```

2. **Configure Database:**

    - Create a MySQL database and update the `application.properties` file with the database URL, username, and password.

3. **Run the Application:**

    - Navigate to the project directory and run:

      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven project structure:

```
/src
|-- main
|   |-- java
|   |   |-- com.expensia
|   |   |   |-- controller
|   |   |   |   |-- AuthController.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ExpenseController.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ImageController.java
|   |   |   |-- model
|   |   |   |   |-- User.java
|   |   |   |   |-- Expense.java
|   |   |   |   |-- Image.java
|   |   |   |-- repository
|   |   |   |   |-- UserRepository.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ExpenseRepository.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ImageRepository.java
|   |   |   |-- service
|   |   |   |   |-- AuthService.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ExpenseService.java
|   |   |   |   |-- ImageService.java
|   |   |-- Application.java
|-- resources
|   |-- application.properties
|   |-- ...
|-- ...
```

- **controller**: Contains classes responsible for handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints.
- **model**: Defines the data models for the application (e.g., User, Expense, Image).
- **repository**: Provides interfaces for database operations related to the defined models.
- **service**: Contains service classes that handle business logic.

## Configuration

The `application.properties` file in the `resources` directory contains configuration settings for the application, including the database connection details.

```properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/expense_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Make sure to update these properties according to your MySQL setup.

## Authentication and Authorization

The backend implements JWT-based authentication and authorization using Spring Security. Upon successful authentication, the server issues a JWT token that must be included in the header of subsequent requests to access protected resources.

## API Endpoints

The API provides endpoints for user authentication, expense management, and image handling. Detailed API documentation can be found [here](API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Data Compression

To optimize data storage and retrieval, the application uses data compression techniques. The `ImageUtils` class includes a method for compressing image data before storing it in the database.

## Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for users, expenses, and images. The relationships between these tables are defined in the data models.
